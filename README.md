# Heuristic Switching Model

Modeling of heterogeneous agent behaviour through learning models, using a heuristic switching model in MATLAB.

## Description

This code fits a heuristic switching model with 4 heuristics (2 simple predictors, 2 advanced predictors) to inflation time-series for both The Netherlands and Germany. The code is used to investigate hetergeneous agent behaviour in forecasting macroeconomic time-series with respect to the time-series stationarity. The other component of the research uses R to test the series for _I(d)_ properties and estimates the long-memory parameters using various techniques.

## Prerequisites

* MATLAB
* Time-series data

## Acknowledgements

* The idea of the heuristic switching model was put forward by [Anufriev & Hommes](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mic.4.4.35).
